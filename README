In order to make the tool useful you need google-chrome browser with the
"Sync" option turned on.  This is because you need to extract
"Known Salt" and "Known Hash" values from  google-chrome settings:

	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
	$ cd ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Sync Data
	$ sqlite3 BookmarkSyncSettings.sqlite3
	jsmith@gmail.com|password_hash2|63126
	jsmith@gmail.com|salt2|INHNIHKCJBPEKLFJGNAGEJBDECFKOCOIOBHGBAOM
	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

	'password_hash2' is your "Known Hash"
	'salt2' is your "Known Salt"

After filling up "Known Hash" and "Known Salt" fields you can start
typing passwords.  If you guessed password the program pops up dialog
informing you about that:

	,-----------------------.
	|                       |
	|  Congradulation!      |
	|                       |
	|  The hashes matches!  |
	|                       |
	|                 [OK]  |
	`-----------------------'

	The password for abovementioned "Known Hash" and "Known Salt" is
	'foobar'.
